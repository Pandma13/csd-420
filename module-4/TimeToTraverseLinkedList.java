// Write a test program that stores 50,000 integers in LinkedList and test the time
// to traverse the list using an iterator vs. using the get(index) method.â€¯

// 1.  Test your program storing first 50,000 and then 500,000 integers.
// 2.  After completing this program and having tested both values, in your comments,
//     explain the results and discuss the time taken using both values and their
//     difference with the get(index) approach.
// 3.  Write test code that ensures the code functions correctly.
